# Social Media Analyzer

The Social Media Analyzer is a Python-based sentiment analysis tool that analyzes text data from social media platforms and predicts sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). It utilizes natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis.

## Features

- Collects social media posts and their sentiment labels for analysis
- Preprocesses the text data by removing special characters, URLs, hashtags, and mentions
- Converts the text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization
- Trains a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the preprocessed data
- Provides real-time sentiment analysis predictions for new social media posts
- Visualizes the sentiment distribution in a bar chart
- Retrieves real-time stock market and crypto updates using the Alpha Vantage API
- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-analyzer.git
## Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt


- Python 3.7 or above
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- NumPy library
- threading library
- smtplib library (for email notifications)
- GUI library (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, PySide)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/taryll1876/real-time-object-detection.git
   Install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install opencv-python numpy

    Replace 'path/to/yolo/config' and 'path/to/yolo/weights' in the code with the respective paths to your YOLO configuration and weights files.

    Customize the code as needed to add additional functionalities or modify the behavior.
    Run the GUI application:
python gui.py

Usage

    Run the main script:

    bash

python main.py

The GUI window will open, displaying the video stream and object detection results.

Use the GUI controls to adjust the confidence threshold, select video sources, and interact with the application.

Enjoy real-time object detection with additional features and functionalities!
