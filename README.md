1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/taryll1876/real-time-object-detection.git
   Install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install opencv-python numpy

    Replace 'path/to/yolo/config' and 'path/to/yolo/weights' in the code with the respective paths to your YOLO configuration and weights files.

    Customize the code as needed to add additional functionalities or modify the behavior.
    Run the GUI application:
python gui.py

Usage

    Run the main script:

    bash

python main.py

The GUI window will open, displaying the video stream and object detection results.

Use the GUI controls to adjust the confidence threshold, select video sources, and interact with the application.

Enjoy real-time object detection with additional features and functionalities!
